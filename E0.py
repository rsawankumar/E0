            Hi ? Are you there ? Ok... I will say 
            story. I created by Error. His other 
            name is TheSadError. He created my on 
            5 May 2022 . He used python3.9 . And he 
            added E1 packet for unknown things. It 
            working awsomely. And I am open source. 
            This means you can see my code and can edit
            them for yourself. For this Error shared 
            my code in his own github repo. Let me explain
            E0 logic. 
            
            Logic : 
            User input a sentence or words probability
            function searching for probability. Which words 
            probability suitability is bigger in database
            E0 prints answear of the w1 base. Its simple AI.
